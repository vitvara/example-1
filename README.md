## Example of Working with Remotes

by Jim Brucker

1. Add a remote to your local repository
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jbrucker/example.git
   ```

2. Push some work **and** tell git to use this as the "default" **upstream** repository:
   ```
   git what???
   ```

3. Next time (git knows your default upstream) just type:
   ```
   git push
   ```
